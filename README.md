# 🎓 Certificate Generator

A lightweight, browser-based **Certificate Generator** that allows you to create personalized certificates for one or multiple recipients. Names are rendered onto a certificate template using HTML Canvas, converted into PDFs, and downloaded together inside a ZIP file — all without any backend.

## 🧑‍💻 How It Works

1. The certificate template (`sample.jpg`) loads onto the canvas.  
2. You enter one or multiple names separated by commas.  
3. Press **Generate** → the first certificate is drawn on the canvas.  
4. Press **Next** to preview certificates for the remaining names.  
5. Press **Download** to export all certificates as PDFs inside a ZIP file.

## 📥 Output Format

Each generated certificate is saved as an individual PDF:

```
John_Doe.pdf
Jane_Smith.pdf
Aarav_Sharma.pdf
```

The final download will be:

```
certificates.zip
```

## 🖼️ Template

- The certificate background file must be named **sample.jpg**.
- It should be placed in the same directory as the HTML file.
- Make sure your template has enough free space to place the name clearly.

---

## 📌 Notes

- Name text is rendered at coordinates `(650, 650)` using:
  - Font: **100px Arial**
  - Color: **black**
- You may adjust the coordinates, font, or style as needed for your template.
